# Countries

# Description

Countries is an Android application that displays the necessary information about the countries of the world and their location on the map.

I decided to develop using the kotlin programming language because I discovered Jetpack composer, an alternative to xml for creating android layouts and I wanted to learn more about this library.

The next step for this application may be to implement network monitoring so that the application can display more explicit messages about the status of network requests and why not give the user the ability to save their favorite countries with their characteristics.
